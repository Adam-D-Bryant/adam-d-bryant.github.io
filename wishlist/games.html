                                An older trivia-esque game.

                                In Wit's End, the players all start at the outer ring of a square gameboard;
                                the goal being to reach the center square. This is done by rolling the die, moving
                                along the track and answering a question. Questions can be analogies, slogans or definitions.
                                Other wild cards can influence the outcome of the game. Players must land on certain squares
                                to move up on a right answer, but a wrong answer will demote that player to the lower ring.
                                First to reach the center wins.

                                Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players in which the aim is to fence off more territory than the opponent.
