                                by a malevolent force which seems intent on imposing suffering and destruction.
                                Can the devil really have arrived on England's shores? And what is it that he hungers

                                By Homer.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The Iliad is the first and the greatest literary achievement of Greek civilisation -
                                an epic poem without rival in the literature of the world, and the cornerstone of Western culture.
                                <br/><br/>
                                The story of the Iliad centres on the critical events in the last year of the Trojan War, which lead
                                to Achilleus' killing of Hektor and determine the fate of Troy. But Homer's theme is not simply war or
                                heroism. With compassion and humanity, he presents a universal and tragic view of the world, of human
                                life lived under the shadow of suffering and death, set against a vast and largely unpitying divine
                                background. The Iliad is the first of the great tragedies.

                                Victor Hugo's tale of injustice, heroism and love follows the fortunes of Jean Valjean,
                                an escaped convict determined to put his criminal past behind him. But his attempts to become
                                a respected member of the community are constantly put under threat: by his own conscience,
                                and by the relentless investigations of the dogged policeman Javert. It is not simply for himself
                                that Valjean must stay free, however, for he has sworn to protect the baby daughter of Fantine,
                                driven to prostitution by poverty.

                                After ten years of war, Odysseus turns his back on Troy and sets sail for home. But his voyage takes another

                                and even the wrath of the gods themselves - before he is reunited with his wife and son.
